all commands:  
* `register [channel] [role] [autorole?]`: Registers the current guild, must be ran first for any other command to work  
* `addrule [title] [description]`: Adds a new rule  
* `removerule [index]`:  Removes a rule by its number  
* `rule [number]`:  Shows a rule by its number  
* `update`: Update rules embed (bot owner only)

This project is currently dormant until I am allowed to access discord (personal family problem), but when I come back:

* Dashboard With SvelteKit
* Switch to MongoDB
* Bug fixes (i dont know what the bugs are yet tho)
* New dev team
* Moderation and appeals system based off of the rules
