all commands:

/addrule - Adds a new rule  
/removerule - Removes a rule by its number  
/rule - Shows a rule by its number  
/update - Update rules embed, mainly used for debug purposes  

This project is currently dormant until I am allowed to access discord (personal family problem), but when I come back:

* Dashboard With SvelteKit
* Switch to MongoDB
* Bug fixes (i dont know what the bugs are yet tho)
* New dev team
